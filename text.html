	<p class="something">A paragraph is a number of sentences grouped together and relating to one topic. Or, a group of related sentences that develop a single point.

This definition shows that the paragraphs of compositions are not mere arbitrary divisions. The division of a chapter into paragraphs must be made according to the changes of ideas introduced.

There is, therefore, no rule as to the length of a paragraph. It may be short or long according to the necessity of the case. A paragraph may consist of a single sentence or of many sentences.

In this aspect, the paragraphs of a piece of prose differ from the stanzas of verses of a poem. The stanza of a poem are usually of the same length and pattern but paragraphs are long or short according to the amount of matter to be expressed under each head.

The Principle of Good Paragraph Structure:

A good paragraph should have three aspects.

1. Unity

2. Order

3. Variety</p>
